# Setup Instructions

## 🎉 New React Project Created!

I've created an exact replica of your Connect2Roots Foundation website as a standalone React + Tailwind project.

## 📍 Location

The new project is located at:
```
/Users/kk927p/Downloads/connect2roots-react-app
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Navigate to the project
```bash
cd /Users/kk927p/Downloads/connect2roots-react-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## ✨ What's Included

✅ **All pages** - Exact replica of all pages from original
✅ **All components** - All UI components and custom components
✅ **All styling** - Complete Tailwind CSS configuration
✅ **All animations** - Scroll reveals, parallax, gradients
✅ **All images** - Connected to Unsplash (same as original)
✅ **Routing** - TanStack Router with all routes
✅ **Responsive design** - Mobile-first, fully responsive

## 🔄 Differences from Original

- **No Internet Computer dependencies** - Pure React app
- **Simplified hooks** - Backend hooks return empty data (ready for your API)
- **Standard React patterns** - Easy to integrate with any backend

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Run the app**: `npm run dev`
3. **Customize**: Update colors, images, or content as needed
4. **Add backend**: Connect forms to your API in `src/hooks/useQueries.ts`

## 🎨 Features
